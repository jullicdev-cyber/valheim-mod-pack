# ValheimPlus

A HarmonyX Mod aimed at improving the gameplay quality of Valheim. The mod includes several different main features that allow users to modify the stats of players, buildings and entities. V+ also offers players the ability to build and place objects with very high precision through a sophisticated system, as well as tweaking and modifying already placed objects with equal precision. The goal is to provide V+ as a base modification for Valheim to increase quality of life, tweak the game's difficulty, and in general, improve the player's experience. V+ also comes with a version and configuration control system for servers and users, enabling server owners to ensure that only players with the same configuration are able to join the server.

### All features can be enabled and tweaked through the V+ config file.

# Installation Instructions

**ATTENTION FOR MULTIPLAYER**:
Both the game and the server should have this mod installed to prevent all kinds of different issues.
If you have the mod installed and then have friends join over steam they should have the mod as well.

Installation instructions for every supported variant — mod manager, manual, client and dedicated server, on Windows and Unix — can be found in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Grantapher/ValheimPlus/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**

# What if the game updates?

Game updates are unlikely to do more than partially break specific features of ValheimPlus at worst.
In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature and wait for it to download/update all files.
This should resolve any issues related. If you continue to have issues, contact the help channel in [our discord server](https://discord.gg/WU69A2JTcn).

For which mod versions work with which game versions, see [COMPATIBILITY.md](https://github.com/Grantapher/ValheimPlus/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md).

# Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement)

- If you have the Server section and enforceMod enabled in the mods config, only players with the same mod version can join your server and you can only join servers with the same mod version installed.
- If you have the Server section and serverSyncsConfig enabled in the mods config, every player joining your server will receive the servers configuration.

**This system is working reliably and is issue-free. Any issues encountered are likely derived from a faulty configuration set up, or the server/client not running v+.**

# Configuration File

The config file is `BepInEx\config\org.bepinex.plugins.valheim_plus.cfg`. It is created the first time you start your game or server, so there is nothing to download or copy in.

If you have [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) installed you can edit the settings in game instead, from the main menu. Settings are read-only while a world is loaded, because most of them only take effect when the game starts.

You can turn off and on every feature of V+ via the config file, by default all settings are turned off.

Upgrading keeps your settings: new options are added to your file with their defaults, and an older `valheim_plus.cfg` is imported once and then set aside as `valheim_plus.cfg.migrated`.

When hosting a server, players who join use the server's settings if you have the `Server` section and the `serverSyncsConfig` option enabled. Their own config file is not modified, and their settings come back when they disconnect. Keybinds, HUD options and field of view always stay the player's own.

Only the server configuration file (located in the server files) needs to be set up when hosting a server with V+ by default.

When hosting for other players over steam, every player will need v+ and they will receive the local settings from the host's game folder.
