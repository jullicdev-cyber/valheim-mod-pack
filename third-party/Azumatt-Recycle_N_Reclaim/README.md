## A mod that allows you to recycle/reclaim items back into resources used to make them. Adds a 'Reclaim' tab/button to the crafting menu. Additionally can be used inside of your inventory directly.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

### Compatible with:

* VNEI
* Jewelcrafting (never worry about losing your gems again!)
* EpicLoot (never worry about losing your enchanted items again!)
* AzuExtendedPlayerInventory
* Auga

### Localization

Recycle_N_Reclaim (RNR) supports localization. This means that you can create language files for different languages.
For example, to add a Swedish translation to this mod, a user could create a `Recycle_N_Reclaim.Swedish.yml` file inside
of
the config folder and add Swedish translations there.

* The following languages in addition to English are translated for you already but might not be fully accurate:
    * Russian
    * Chinese
    * French
    * German
    * Japanese
    * Korean
    * Spanish

## Original Author's Credits

All original code for the crafting tab/button was written

## Mod Information

This mod is a combination
of [OdinsInventoryDiscard](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/OdinsInventoryDiscard/) and the mod above.
The aim is to provide an all-in-one solution for
recycling items back into resources.

All code changes after the initial release of this mod was written by me. This includes the merging of the two mods,
addition of ServerSync and
any improvements made to the code.

<details><summary><b>Configuration Options</b> (Azumatt.Recycle_N_Reclaim.cfg)</summary>

### Please note that Inventory Recycle and Reclaiming are different sections as well as different functionality within the game. Recycling happens only in the inventory and (by default) limited to admins only. Change the config should you wish to give this ability to everyone. Admins will always (by default) get 100% of the resources returned to them. Reclaiming happens in the crafting menu and is available to everyone. The amount of resources returned is configurable but is 50% by default.

#### What this looks like in the [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)

  is 0.5 (50%), the player will receive half of the resources they would usually need to craft the item, assuming a

* If enabled, it will hide hotbar items in the crafting tab.
  Enabled by default.
    * Default Value: On

StationFilterEnabled [Synced with Server]

* If enabled, will filter all recycling recipes based on the crafting station
  used to produce said item. Main purpose of this is to prevent showing food
  as a recyclable item, but can be extended further if needed.
  Enabled by default
    * Default Value: On

StationFilterList [Synced with Server]
